## Description
  This webpage is an overview of lessons learned in Week 3 of Epicodus. A form takes user input as a whole number between 1 and 100. It then creates a string of numbers counting up to that number, incrementing by 1. Each of the numbers in the string that include a 3 are replaced by "Won't you be my neighbor". Each of the numbers that include a 2 but not a 3 are replaced by "Boop!". Each of the numbers that include a 1 but not a 2 or 3 are replaced by "Beep!"
